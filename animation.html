                <div>
                    <p>In this theme, it was an induvidual work. And we learned about creating our own animation and our
                        first game. the theme was intact with more coding like HTML, CSS and finally we have been
                        introduced with JAVA Script. Not only that we have also learned how to draw flat design to use
                        in our game.</p>
                    <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
                    <p>In this animation theme I must create an interactive, animated game! It must keep within the
                        limits
                        and requirement for mechanics and aesthetics, but Iwas free to decide genre, style, and content.
                        All
                        assignments in this theme, are partial instalments of the final assignment, and this is the
                        first
                        one, where I had to describe my game idea as a paper prototype.It was an individual assignment,
                        where I had to create my game elements all by myself.</p>
                    <p>It was first task towards creating my game.There were some requirements I had to follow during
                        creating our paper protype. Like I shouldn't have more than 10 clickable objects on the screen
                        at
                        any given time.</p>
                    <h4>The following UI elements must be visible at all times:</h4>
                    <ul class="ulfah">
                        <li>Score indicator</li>
                        <li>Health indicator</li>
                        <li>Time indicator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I had to decide if the various indicators should be digits, progress bars, a number of hearts, or
                        something completely different.</p>
                    <p>Here is the video link of my paper prototype.<a
                            href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/f55c24a0-02f2-43d2-b24f-56150fbc23c4?list=studio&referrer=https:%2F%2Ffahmida0826.dk%2F">Click
                            here!</a></p>
                    <h3>Activity Diagram</h3>
                    <p>The next assignment is, like all other assignments in this theme, a partial instalment of the
                        final
                        assignment. In this part we describe our game idea as an activity diagram. we have already made
                        a
                        paper prototype video, and the activity diagram is supposed to be a more formalised description
                        of
                        the same game.The main purpose of the activity diagram, is to make sure that I have thought
                        through
                        the logic of my game – that all the rules fit together, and that I am absolutely sure of what
                        the
                        mechanics are. This will be of immense value when I start coding the game!</p>
                    <p>Paper is perfectly fine for sketching, but here I must draw the finished activity diagram on the
                        computer, for handin. I can use any program I like, but I must use an actual diagram-drawing
                        application, and not Photoshop, Illustrator, or any other program that cannot keep boxes and
                        arrows
                        connected. Therefore I chose to draw to activity diagram on the app called lucid.</p>

                    <h3>Asset list and design documentation</h3>
                    <p>The focus of this assignment is to create the design for a game, to document the design
                        decision’s
                        and make the asset list so that it meets the requirements. THat means during the entire theme,
                        I’ll
                        keep a log and add relevant entries as required in the list of requirements listed in the
                        assignment
                        description.The assignment was also an individual task.</p>
                    <p>Assets are all the elements, graphics and sounds, used in the game. For now, I only have
                        graphics,
                        so the asset list will be a simple webpage that displays every single visual asset in the game.
                        In
                        other words, a webpage with a lot of images. There are no requirements for layout or design, but
                        all
                        the images must be the SVG files exported from Illustrator, the same files that I use in the
                        game.</p>

                    <h3>Animation Project - The Game - Final Version</h3>
                    <p>At last I must create an interactive, animated game! The game must run in a browser, and I must
                        implement it using basic browser technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I must draw all
                        graphics
                        by myself, as well as record and edit sounds for the game. This is first time I was about to
                        learn
                        JavaScript.</p>
                    <p><strong>Here is the game link in the browser. <a
                                href="https://fahmida0826.dk/kea/04_animation/balloonspop/product/">Click here!</a> And
                            here
                            is how it looks at a glance.</strong></p>
