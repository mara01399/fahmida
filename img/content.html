                <div>
                    <p>In this theme we learned about shooting and editing video. We learned working in Adobe Premier
                        Pro program. we also learned how to calibrate the screen and how to apply color correction in
                        video. We learned how to make a storyboard. Customer pitch also was a part of our project since
                        it was a group project.</p>
                    <h3>A Story Without Words</h3>
                    <p>In the first week of the last theme "Basic Content", I had to Create a short video (1 min) that
                        tells a story without the use of any words - neither spoken or written.The focus was on telling
                        a
                        story. I could use sound effects and music as well as both diegetic and non-diegetic sounds as
                        long
                        as they are neither dialog or narration. In the segment the task was individual.</p>
                    <p>The requirement of making the video was, it must be recorded in my mobile phone and edited in
                        Adobe
                        Premiere Pro. I have never use premier pro before. So it was a kind of challange for me.</p>

                    <h3>Pre-production part 1 - Treatment</h3>
                    <p>The next assignment was a group work. I was in a fantastic group of my five classmates. In this
                        assignment we had to make a treatment plan of our preproduction with the following content.</p>
                    <ul class="ulfah">
                        <li>A title- Is supposed to create interest and curiosity.</li>
                        <li>A theme- An emotion and a working line for the crew.</li>
                        <li>A logline- Present the protagonist, the antagonist, the conflict. In order to know, who is
                            doing
                            what and what is the opposition.</li>
                        <li>The treatment- And finally we had to write the entire story.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Pre-production part 2 - Storyboard</h3>
                    <p>Our story board is the entire video shot by shot with all relevant information for us to create
                        the
                        video and for a production manager to test our video before production. In our storyboard we
                        must
                        describe shots and angles etc. The storyboard must be clear how the shot is framed. If our
                        subject
                        or camera is moving, we must write that explicitly. The storyboard must also include a
                        dramaturgical
                        curve, where we show the rise and fall of intensity in our video.</p>
                    <h4>The storyboard must include the following information:</h4>
                    <ul class="ulfah">
                        <li>Location and time</li>
                        <li>Framing(close up,middle shot..)</li>
                        <li>Angle if different from normal</li>
                        <li>Camera movements if any (zoom, pan…)</li>
                        <li>Any transitions</li>
                        <li>Important sounds</li>
                        <li>A short description in words if necessary</li>
                        <li>Props, clothes, light and anything else essential.</li>
                    </ul>

                        have created two personas form which we were inspired of our target audience.</h4>

                    <h3>Customer pitch</h3>
                    <p>In this assignment we had to prepare a pitch that is a combination of the presentation format
                        Pecha
                        Kucha and showing our end product.</p>
                    <h4>The Pecha Kucha slides must include the following:</h4>
                    <ul class="ulfah">
                        <li>Our website must be included, somehow, as a part of our presentation.</li>
                        <li>Our visual design must be demonstrated and included in the pitch.</li>
                        <li>Have the client brief’s needs, goals and wishes for the solutions in mind.</li>
                        <li>Use knowledge from personas and the target audience to support decisions.</li>
                        <li>We had to make our pitch informative, to-the-point and a convincing story of our work.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Our final project-Free Fridge Copenhagen</h3>
                    <p>In this project, we had to create a website for Free Fridge Copenhagen and integrate video
                        content
                        on the site with a new visual expression understood as: logo, colour scheme and typography.</p>
                    <p>All with
                        the purpose to strengthen their online presence It should mostly appeal to pathos, not logos.
                        Also,
                        lay out the page with some relevant text content.Basically, we are to create a site and content
                        that
                        addresses some of these issues. We will have to use all our skills regarding target audiences,
                        user
                        experiences and visual expressions to engage the users and inspire them to participate.</p>
