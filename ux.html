                <div>
                    <p>Second theme was all about to User experience. It was a team work. We had to work in groups. We
                        learned working in programs like Adobe XD, Illustrator and reaserch method like Five Second
                        Test. Using these tools, we learned how to work with data collections, prototyping and
                        communicating with the stakeholders.</p>
                    <p>During the theme of UX I practised my skills at four different kinds of research methods for
                        collecting data followed by an analysis of the data collected and a representation of both my
                        research and insights from those data.</p>
                    <h3>Tasks included in this assignment was:</h3>
                    <ul class="ulfah">
                        <li>Desk research</li>
                        <li>Observation research</li>
                        <li>Interview research</li>
                        <li>Survey research</li>
                        <li>Present research and analysis insights</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>It was an indidual work on the first week of the theme. I had to choose one of the three
                            topics.
                            Topics are given below. And I chose to go with T-shirt Production.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ulfah">
                        <li>T-shirt production</li>
                        <li>Online shops selling t-shirts</li>
                        <li>T-shirt trends amongst customers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I had to collect data on the tasks method that has been given before. And here what I gathered
                        from my research.</p>

                    <h3>First group work:</h3>
                    <p>The second module's assignment was a group work and focuses on getting from first ideas to Early
                        Prototypes for the concept of a small webshop selling t-shirts. Informed by my research, we had
                        to
                        find out what sort of a t-shirt webshop we will be making and who our target audience are.</p>
                    <p>We made a very good group to work with. They were so helpfull during the task.</p>
                    <p>The prototype must include 10 different items (t-shirts) or more. Our early prototypes must be
                        designed in Adobe XD and made either as a website or app. The focus is on working with UI and UX
                        conventions, design patterns and UI kits, and also, we have to produce relevant content. A
                        required
                        part of our design is the purchase flow for users interested in buying an item after having
                        visited
                        our webshop. Our XD-prototype must be testable on mobile or computer for testing Thursday next
                        week.
                        We were to find or create pictures and text in accord with the type of t-shirt webshop we create
                        as
                        a solution.</p>
                    <h3>The prototype must be designed for:</h3>
                    <p>The target audience user’s goal in visiting our webshop is as a minimum to buy a product that we
                        are
                        selling that they find meets their needs and preferences.</p>
                    <p>The user found the site to learn more about the product and possibly buy it from us.
                        The user searched online (text or voice query) for the product and has now ended up on a
                        specific
                        page of our webshop (can be the homepage, but might not be).</p>
                    <p>The goal of the business is, of course, to sell a product to the customer that is the right
                        product
                        for the customer to avoid having to receive return goods or other trouble.</p>
                    <p>And therefore we have came with an Early Prototype for the users. Have a look at our work.</p>
                    <p>Here You can see the whole processes we have done so far. We had to do alot of paper work, notes,
                        ideas, crazy 8s, sketches of story board and finally XD work. We actually divided our work
                        within
                        us. So that people will not feel overwhelmed. Check out our early prototype work in XD by

                    <h3>Now it´s time to come up with a solution for the user.</h3>
                    <p>So far, we’ve worked on deciding on ideas developing early prototypes if our concept and testing
                        our
                        t-shirt webshop and concept selling a specific type of product to a specific type of target
                        audience
                        defined in detail by us. Hopefully, we also produced some insights and decided what to improve
                        in
                        the next and final iteration of our solution!</p>
                    <p>Now, our job is to finalise our XD prototype as a proof-of-concept solution prototype and
                        document
                        the solution in a visually sharp and communicative format. In descriptions, footnotes and
                        references
                        make it clear how our solution can be traced back into test and research insights as well as in
                        UX
                        design principles and practices!</p>
                        <embed src="img/030301_Solution_The-Incredibles.pdf" width="700" height="500"/>
                    <h4>Now it´s time to prepare an amazinly convincing proof-of-concept pitch of our solution to our XD
                        problems.</h4>
                    <p>Here we have to present ourselves and our agenda. We have to make our concept very clear like
                        what
                        the problem and what is our unique selling propositon. We have to tell the story behind in order
                        to
                        convince the client.we have to be very clear about what we are presenting.</p>
